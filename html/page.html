		<p>Deals primarily with the reinterpretation of semiotic values associated with the notion of housing and their effect on the possibilities of form, and secondarily with the form itself as a firmly set product</p>

		<h3>Understanding student housing</h3>
		
		<p>Student housing projects are intended for users in a transitional phase of their life, one during which they leave their family lives – lives they were used to – and prepare themselves for independent living – lives they need to get used to. Such dual delimitation of this phase with drastically opposite lifestyles can induce an unlimited number of similar ambivalent relations. THE SPACE OF deals with one of those relations – community and non-community, i.e. aloneness – inside a single student housing microsystem.</p>

		<h3>Inside a triad</h3>
		
		<p>Social interdependability represents an important and inevitable parameter of student life. It happens during a period of time in which a break between family life and independence takes place making human beings inertly demand forming certain kinds of relations with other people in order for what is recognized as habit to remain intact.</p>

		<p>In that sense, the wider topic “33 for 3" introduces the sociological notion of <a href="#">triad</a>, a group of three people (who, in this case, live together and compose the smallest structure in the student housing ambience).</p>

<h4>Explore the unexplored red fox over the wolf</h4></code></pre>

		<p>Triads have been explored by scientists since the end of the nineteenth century and one common rule that has been widely observed is that in any group of three people two will tend to unite against the other one. Such a strong determinant of a <a href="#">social group of</a> groups that makes it apparently unstable and therefore potentially non-functional, and given that such way of grouping people was assigned (assumed) as primary inside the student housing system, a new need is introduced: the need for the creation of a spatial prefix which will <a href="#">reduce the group’s potential</a> to jeopardize social relations inside the community, especially in the context of the recognized topic of the relation of togetherness and aloneness.</p>
